# Apple HomeKit Camera from Raspberry Pi with Computer Vision as Motion Sensor

Following the instruction you will get Apple Homekit compatible camera with 
some Shortcuts that saves image to local/cloud storage on motion action. 
The main thing here that we are able to define the motion by our own 
Computer Vision algorithm. For example, it can trigger only for cats or humans.

Required hardware: SMI Camera (such as Raspberry Pi Camera V2), 
Raspberry Pi V2 (or higher), MicroSD card, 
Apple Homekit Client (on your iOS or MacOS device),
optional Apple HomeKit Hub (TV of HomePod).

This guide implies you are already flashed Raspbian OS, wired your 
SMI camera and established SSH connection throw LAN. Also, it is required
that you have created home instance in your HomeKit App.

## Step 1: Install and configure Homebridge

The right way is to follow the 
[Official Installation Guide](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/wiki/Install-Homebridge-on-Raspbian).

When the Homebridge service is up and Uomebridge UI is abalible throw 
the Web install the official FFMPEG camera pluging with jscript paacket manager:
```
sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm homebridge-camera-ffmpeg
```

The next step is to the following platform configuration to the 
main Homebridge config
```
{
    "platform": "Camera-ffmpeg",
    "porthttp": "8080",
    "topic": "homebridge",
    "cameras": [
        {
            "name": "RPi Camera",
            "manufacturer": "Akhmedov Inc.",
            "motion": true,
            "motionTimeout": 1,
            "videoConfig": {
                "source": "-re -f video4linux2 -i /dev/video0",
                "stillImageSource": "-re -f video4linux2 -ss 0.9 -i /dev/video0 -vframes 1",
                "audio": false,
                "maxStreams": 1,
                "maxWidth": 1440,
                "maxHeight": 1080,
                "maxFPS": 30,
                "vcodec": "h264_omx"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

`motion` - activates motion sensor for the camera. 
In case of raspberry Pi camera we dont dave physical one, but we still can emitate
attendence of the sensor by the MQTT trigger that is running on port `TODO`. This
can be called from the
[Python API](https://sunoo.github.io/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/automation/motion.html).
More informaion on this functionality is avalible 
[here](https://sunoo.github.io/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg/automation/http.html).

`motionTimeout` - option that allows automatic deactivation of trigger on timeout.
The other way is to set it to zero so automatic deactivation is disabled an you can
control it manually throw MQTT interface.

`porthttp` - enables HTTP interface to the MQTT broker, so we are able to trigger 
motion event by HTTP request like `http://192.168.31.106:8080/motion/motion?RPi%20Camera`,
where `%20` is the equivalent of the Space Character in the camera name.

Note: if the camera mount don't allow you to get correct video orientation 
and the image is upside-down or flipped the option `videoFilter` can be applied. 
For example: `"videoFilter": "transpose=2,transpose=2"` or `"videoFilter": "rotate=PI/2"`

Now, the RPi camera and fake motion sensor could be added and must be avalible 
from Apple HomeKit App.

## Step 2: Create Apple Shortcut + Python automation on the fake motion sensor event

The main idea of ane Smart thing is an automation. Let us provide an automation 
for the "motion action". There is a powerful tool for this - Shortcats. In the
latest versions of iOS and MacOS we are able to create shortcuts that are running 
on a personal device or for the HomeKit Hub. Here we can make native HomeKit 
actions and execute SSH commandas on come mashine remotly. The last point 
is a point of interest.

Note: the command field of the SSH execution configuration must be filled with 
absolut path and the content of the screapt must use absolut pathes too.

The [following script]()
will take a short video from the camera and save it lockaly. As the 
result we can get cut functionality of Apple Security Video API. The
execution must look like this:

```
python3 ~/security_record.py
```

This approach has two disadvantages: recording can not be asyncony and 
recording can not in parallel with video monitoring. Solving of this
will be proposed in next guide.


## Step 3: Multiuser streaming service at backend

```
nohup raspivid -n -t 0 -w 1440 -h 1080 -fps 30 -ih -fl -l -o - | nc -klvp 8000
```

```
nc 192.168.31.122 8000 | mplayer -fps 200 -demuxer h264es -
ffmpeg -i tcp://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

```
"source": "-i tcp://127.0.0.1:8000",
"stillImageSource": "-i tcp://127.0.0.1:8000",
"maxStreams": 2,
```

```
sudo cp src/*.service /lib/systemd/system/
sudo chmod 644 /lib/systemd/system/*.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable rpi-streamer
sudo systemctl enable cv-motion
```

/etc/rc.local

```
nohup python3 /home/rolan/rpi_camera_homekit/src/rpi_streamer.py &
nohup python3 /home/rolan/rpi_camera_homekit/src/cv_surveillance_sensor.py &
```

```
ps aux | grep python
kill -9 CV_PROC_ID
kill -9 STREAM_PROC_ID
```

## Step 4: Custom computer vision pipeline as a Motion sensor



## Step 5: After the end

```
vcgencmd measure_temp | egrep -o '[0-9]*\.[0-9]*'
```
